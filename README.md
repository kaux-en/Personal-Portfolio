A personal portfolio?? About me?? 
Yes. This project is my personal portfolio. 
This portfolio was initially created with one tab containing HTML code that was structured all on one page with separate sections.
These HTML sections includes an about me segment (section 2), a code snippet for section 3 (Projects), a chart for section 4 (skills), and a contact form for the last section (contact me).

The now enhanced portfolio will include a tab for CSS coding. For clean organization, the stylesheet is separated by commented-out section titles. These comments start with a '/*' and ends with '*/'.

I hope you enjoy it.
