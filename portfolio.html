            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kiara. Usually you can't judge a book by it's cover but as the picture above suggests; Yes, I am a lover of laughter. The amount of things I love will need at least two pages so we'll stick with the basics. I am an aspiring software engineer with knowledge of UX/Ui designing and a love for food and family. </p>

            <h2>To-Do List App</h2>
            <p>This is a python programming mini-project.</p>
            <p>Below, you will see python code that employs a dictionary tool to express a to-do list for household chores. The code also includes nested-if statements, defined functions and error handling.</p>
